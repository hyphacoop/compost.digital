COMPOST is a magazine about the digital commons. But we also see it as a process to metabolize and renew our relationships with the Web, to imagine and build interdependent, equitable, and solidarity-based systems of communication and knowledge sharing.

This is a project of the [Distributed Press](https://distributed.press), made possible by our [partners and supporters](./about.html#partners-and-supporters).

# ISSUE 01: FERTILE GROUNDS

The theme of the first issue is **fertile grounds**. As large swathes of the Web decay, we want to explore how its remains can help new networks flourish. What are the raw materials we can work with? What tools can we employ? What worlds can we shape together?

We are featuring works that are approachable, intimate, and grounded in experience. Contributors are examining the Web from a place of abundance, to reflect on the projects, communities, technologies, protocols, and networks that enable authentic and trustful connections. Even as much of existing digital infrastructure fails to embolden truth or bring people together, we want to recognize the parts that give us hope.

This magazine is a pilot of Distributed Press, a larger project to build digital publishing infrastructure that is managed collectively and horizontally. In our endeavors, participatory governance will create the feedback loops that help us respond to the evolving needs of our authors and readers. Collective ownership will help us share costs and risks while achieving success together.

We will be publishing works with the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike International 4.0 license (CC BY-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) by default. On a case by case basis, we would support authors who want to experiment with other types of licensing.

### PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPMENT

Contributors to COMPOST will also participate in strategic decisionmaking and share in the financial success of our magazine. In addition to the time they devote to creating their piece, contributors will join us during scheduled conversations to help us:

- Lay the foundations for COMPOST to become a [co-operative enterprise](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/what-is-a-cooperative), so that it is democratically owned and controlled by its contributing members;
- Conceptualize and validate new revenue streams using [web monetization](https://webmonetization.org/), Open Collective, and Gitcoin through tips, donations, subscriptions, crowdfunds, or selling premium works and experiences;
- Create a supportive creative environment, encouraging constructive peer feedback and discussions about our magazine's content and digital implementation;
- Imagine equitable web futures. COMPOST will be published to multiple [DWeb](https://breakermag.com/the-decentralized-web-explained-in-words-you-can-understand/) and Web endpoints, allowing us to use the distinct features of protocols such as [Hypercore](https://hypercore-protocol.org), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), [SSB](https://scuttlebutt.nz/), among others. What new interactions, communities, and experiences can we cultivate?

### PAYMENT FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

For each contributor, we have budgeted:

- USD $300 flat fee for participation in development of this project; and an additional
- USD $300 ~ $800 for creative work, to allow for a range of pieces.

Once the magazine is launched, contributors could also receive additional payments (e.g. through tips, donations, etc.), depending on our joint decisions around revenues.
